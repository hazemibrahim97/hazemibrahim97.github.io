# Personal Website

A clean, minimalist personal academic website template inspired by modern academic websites.

## Setup

1. **Replace the placeholder content** in `index.html`:
   - Add your headshot image as `headshot.jpg` in the root directory
   - Update your name, title, and email
   - Write your bio
   - Add your research interests
   - List your publications
   - Add media coverage section with images
   - Add your teaching and service information

2. **Customize the styling** in `style.css` if desired

3. **Deploy your website**:

   **Option A: GitHub Pages (Recommended)**
   - Create a new repository on GitHub
   - Push these files to the repository
   - Go to Settings → Pages
   - Select the branch and folder (usually `main` branch and `/root`)
   - Your site will be available at `https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name`

   **Option B: Any static hosting service**
   - Upload the files to Netlify, Vercel, or any hosting service
   - The site will work as static HTML

## Customization Tips

- **Headshot**: Place a square image (recommended: 400x400px or larger) named `headshot.jpg` in the root directory
- **Media Coverage Images**: Add screenshots of media coverage (e.g., `media-coverage-1.jpg`, `media-coverage-2.jpg`, etc.) in the root directory
- **Colors**: Modify the color scheme in `style.css` (look for hex codes like `#2c3e50`, `#3498db`)
- **Fonts**: Change the font-family in `style.css` to match your preference
- **Sections**: Add or remove sections as needed by copying the structure from existing sections
